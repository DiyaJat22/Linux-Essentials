The `7z` command is used for high-compression archiving with the **7-Zip** format (`.7z`). It supports multiple compression algorithms and provides better compression rates than `gzip` or `bzip2`.  



## **`7z`**  

### **Syntax**  
```
7z [OPTIONS] archive_name.7z file1 file2 ...
```

### **Examples**  

- Create a `.7z` archive:  
  ```
  7z a archive.7z file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

- Create a `.7z` archive from a directory:  
  ```
  7z a archive.7z my_folder/
  ```

- Create a `.7z` archive with maximum compression:  
  ```
  7z a -mx=9 archive.7z my_folder/
  ```

- Extract a `.7z` archive:  
  ```
  7z x archive.7z
  ```

- Extract to a specific directory:  
  ```
  7z x archive.7z -o/path/to/destination/
  ```

- Extract a `.7z` archive without directories:  
  ```
  7z e archive.7z
  ```

- List contents of a `.7z` archive:  
  ```
  7z l archive.7z
  ```

- Test the integrity of a `.7z` archive:  
  ```
  7z t archive.7z
  ```

- Add files to an existing `.7z` archive:  
  ```
  7z u archive.7z newfile.txt
  ```

- Delete a file from an archive:  
  ```
  7z d archive.7z file1.txt
  ```

- Encrypt a `.7z` archive with a password:  
  ```
  7z a -pMySecurePassword archive.7z my_folder/
  ```

- Encrypt a `.7z` archive with a password and hide filenames:  
  ```
  7z a -pMySecurePassword -mhe=on archive.7z my_folder/
  ```
